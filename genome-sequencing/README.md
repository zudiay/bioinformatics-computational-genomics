# Genome Sequencing

A genome sequencing application. 

The [dataset](https://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/data/extradatasets/assembly/string_reconstruction_from_read_pairs.txt) provided by the Rosalind platform is used. Please download the dataset from this link.

In the dataset provided for this question, k = 50 and d = 200, where d refers to the number of nucleotides
between two read pairs. To simplify the problem, perfect coverage and error-free reads are assumed.
