# Phylogenetic Tree

This project is about the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
The [dataset](http://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UK-Coronavirus-Data.zip) curated by Kunal Joshi & Phillip Compeau is used.
The dataset is loaded and visualized the data, and a phylogenetic tree is constructed based on it.

For simplicity, the project focuses on the gene that encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus (or a subset thereof). 
The spike protein gene refers to the nucleotide sequence between the positions 21563 and 25384 (inclusive, positions are 0-indexed). 
The positions are determined by the annotation of SARS-CoV-2 genome.
